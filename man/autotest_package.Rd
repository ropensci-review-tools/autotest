\usage{
autotest_package(
  package = ".",
  functions = NULL,
  exclude = NULL,
  test = FALSE,
  test_data = NULL,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{package}{Name of package, as either
\enumerate{
\item Path to local package source
\item Name of installed package
\item Full path to location of installed package if not on \link{.libPaths}, or
\item Default which presumes current directory is within package to be
tested.
}}

\item{functions}{Optional character vector containing names of functions of
nominated package to be included in 'autotesting'.}

\item{exclude}{Optional character vector containing names of any functions of
nominated package to be excluded from 'autotesting'.}

\item{test}{If \code{FALSE}, return only descriptions of tests which would be run
with \code{test = TRUE}, without actually running them.}

\item{test_data}{Result returned from calling either \link{autotest_types} or
\link{autotest_package} with \code{test = FALSE} that contains a list of all tests
which would be conducted. These tests have an additional flag, \code{test}, which
defaults to \code{TRUE}. Setting any tests to \code{FALSE} will avoid running them when
\code{test = TRUE}.}

\item{quiet}{If 'FALSE', provide printed output on screen.}
}
\value{
An \code{autotest_package} object which is derived from a \pkg{tibble}
\code{tbl_df} object. This has one row for each test, and the following nine
columns:
\enumerate{
\item \code{type} The type of result, either "dummy" for \code{test = FALSE}, or one
of "error", "warning", "diagnostic", or "message".
\item \code{test_name} Name of each test
\item \code{fn_name} Name of function being tested
\item \code{parameter} Name of parameter being tested
\item \code{parameter_type} Expected type of parameter as identified by
\code{autotest}.
\item \code{operation} Description of the test
\item \code{content} For \code{test = FALSE}, the expected behaviour of the test; for
\code{test = TRUE}, the observed discrepancy with that expected behaviour
\item \code{test} If \code{FALSE} (default), list all tests without implementing them,
otherwise implement all tests.
\item \verb{yaml_hash' A unique hash which may be be used to extract the }yaml`
specification of each test.
}
Some columns may contain NA values, as explained in the Note.
}
\description{
Automatically test an entire package by converting examples to \code{yaml} format
and submitting each to the \link{autotest_single_trace} function.
}
\note{
Some columns may contain NA values, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{parameer} and \code{parameter_type}, for tests applied to entire
functions, such as tests of return values.
\item \code{test_name} for warnings or errors generated through "normal"
function calls generated directly from example code, in which case \code{type}
will be "warning" or "error", and \code{content} will contain the content of
the corresponding message.
